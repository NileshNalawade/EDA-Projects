# EDA-Shopping-Trends

This repository contains the code and write-up for my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on shopping trends.

* Purchase frequency and value analysis helps optimize pricing strategies and promotions.
* Marketing campaign effectiveness is evaluated, guiding future campaign development.

**Data Visualization**

The project utilizes various data visualization techniques, including:

* piecharts
* Scatter plots
* Bar charts

These visualizations effectively communicate the extracted insights.

**Benefits**

The project findings can be used to:

* Increase sales and revenue
